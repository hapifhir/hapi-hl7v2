							third component is present, then the second must also
							be present (although in this case the first is optional).
							The second and third components must either both be
							valued (both non-null), or both be not valued (both null).
							This means that if all three components of the HD are

							be present (although in this case the first is optional).
							The second and third components must either both be
							valued (both non-null), or both be not valued (both null).
							This means that if all three components of the HD are
							valued, the entity identified by the first component is the
							same as the entity identified by components two and
							three taken together. However, implementers may
							choose, by site agreement, to specify that if all three
							components of the HD are valued, the first component
							defines a member in the set defined by the second and
							third components.
