        	<action type="fix" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3571839">
            	Fixed incorrect generation of ACK messages for HL7 versions newer
            	than 2.4. Thanks to Anne-Gaelle for reporting.
            </action> 
          	<action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3570493">
        		ModelClassFactory define their own event map location, where the
        		mapping between event and message structure is defined.
        		Compatibility notice: Parser.getMessageStructureForEvent is not static anymore
        		and was deprecated.
        	</action>
        	<action type="fix" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="1834598">
            	Fixed bug in DefaultXMLParser. Thanks to Leo Marcov for reporting.
            </action> 
			<action type="fix" dev="Jens Villadsen, Christian Ohr" issue="3552470">
            	Deprecated LowerLayerProtocol.makeLLP as there is now the choice
            	between MinLowerLayerProtocol and ExtendedMinLowerLayerProtocol.
            </action> 
          	<action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr">
        		ValidationContext can now be more conveniently configured using
        		ValidationRuleBuilders. All predefined ValidationContext classes have
        		been reimplemented to be defined by such builders.
        	</action>
            <action type="fix" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3564428">
            	HapiContext becomes the unique source of configuration. Changing a
            	context object immediately changes the configuration of all connected
            	parsers, servers etc. Message-specific ValidationContext has been
            	deprecated and will be removed in the next version. 
            </action>        
            <action type="fix" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3515725">
            	XML Parser is now able to handle escape sequences that are relevant for
            	XML encoding when parsing and rendering. Thanks to Alberto Saez Torres
            	for reporting.
            </action>
            <action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3515833">
            	Introduced HapiContext, which aggregates most of the configuration and allows
            	to instantiate correspondingly configured HAPI services 
            	(parsers, validators, servers, ...).
            </action>
            <action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3515828">
            	All XML processing is based on DOM Level 3 and uses the standard libraries, 
				which are included in JRE 5 and newer.
				Therefore, no external XML-related libraries are required anymore.
				<![CDATA[<br><br>]]>
				The default XML implementation can be overridden this by setting the system property 
				org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementationSourceList to the external DOM implementation and
				org.xml.sax.driver to an external SAX implementation. 
				<![CDATA[<br>]]>
				When Xerces 2.11 is used as
				external XML processor library, org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementationSourceList must be
				set to org.apache.xerces.dom.DOMXSImplementationSourceImpl and org.xml.sax.driver must
				be set to org.apache.xerces.parsers.SAXParser.
            </action>
            <action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3515832">
            	Added a set of new message ID generators, to be centrally configured using the
				ParserConfiguration class. Provides non-persistent generators and the
				possibility to plug in custom ID generators.
            </action>
            <action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3494927">
            	Make Message Validation more versatile by adding a ValidationExceptionHandler
				that is called on every violation of a validation rule. A new implementation
				of such a handler (RespondingValidationExceptionHandler) is capable of creating
				response messages based on the validation result.

        		Minor API enhancements:

        		<ul>
        			<li>
        				ConnectionHub has a new factory method which accepts an LLP instance but
        				does not require a boolean flag to indicate whether TLS is being
        				used (added for consistency with other methods).
        			</li>
        			<li>
        				A number of internal log statements which are only really useful
        				if you are familiar with HAPI internals have been changed from
        				DEBUG level to TRACE level, to make debug level logging easier 
        				to understand.
        			</li>
        			<li>
        				Service classes (such as SimpleServer) now have a startAndWait() method
						which doesn't return until the service has successfully started

        				instance associated with the message is set appropriately to either the
        				Pipe Parser or the XML Parser. This means that calls to

        		AbstractMessage#generateAck()
        		now sets the Parser instance associated with the generated Ack message to 
        		be the same instance as its own instance. This means for instance that if a

            <action type="fix" dev="mmartin (laguna27)" issue="3566636">
            	Fix an issue parsing XML encoded messages where any segment groups with a four letter
            	name are ignored (e.g. the DIET group in an OMD_O01 message). Thanks to mmartin

			<action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr / James Agnew" issue="3421082">
            	Make TestPanel more usable. Amongst other changes, it's now possible to load HL7 messages

				restarted in the meanwhile.
            </action>
        	<action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3421083">
        		Convert HAPI to use the 
				<![CDATA[
	            	<a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</a>
				]]>
        		logging framework in place of Apache Jakarta Commons-Logging (JCL). SLF4J is 
        		conceptually similar to JCL, in that it is a wrapper around an underlying 
        		framework of your choice (e.g. log4j, java.util.Logger, etc.). It brings a number
        		of modern features with it, such as parameterized entries and NDCs, and uses a
        		less confusing discovery process.
				<![CDATA[<br><br>]]>
				Applications which use HAPI will now need to add the "slf4j-api.jar" JAR to their
				classpath, as well as a second JAR such as "slf4j-log4j12.jar" which instructs SLF4J
				which underlying log framework to use. These two dependencies have been added to the
				hapi-base pom.xml, so Maven users will see this change automatically.
				<![CDATA[<br><br>]]>
        		In addition, HapiLog has been deprecated. HapiLog was used as a logging system prior to
        		the introduction of commons-logging into HAPI. It is no longer referenced by any
        		part of HAPI itself, and will be removed at some point in the future.

        	<action type="add" dev="James Agnew">
        		Add new method to group and message structure classes that returns all repetitions
        		of repeatable children as a typed List. This is useful for quickly and easily
        		iterating over structures within a message.
        		<![CDATA[<br/><br/>]]>

  few enhancements. The primary focus of this release is in fixing issues relating to
  parsing and encoding. In particular, a number of issues specific to parsing of
  OBX-5 (Varies) values have been corrected.">
            <action type="fix" dev="James Agnew">
            	Fix one regression in HAPI 1.2-beta1, where a group containing at least one
            	mandatory segment would sometimes be encoded as an empty segment 
            	even if no content was added to it.
            </action>
            <action type="add" dev="James Agnew">
            	Add two new system properties which allow OBX segments messages to be parsed
            	even if they are either missing, or have an invalid value in OBX-2 (which defines
            	the datatype used in OBX-5).

            	When encoding a group using the PipeParser where the first segment is required, but no data has been populated in that segment, 
            	the empty segment is now still encoded if needed as a blank segment in order to give parsers a hint about which 
            	group further segments are in. This helps to ensure that messages can be "round tripped", meaning that
            	a message which is parsed, encoded, and then re-parsed should contain exactly the same structure from
            	beginning to end. 
            	For example, in an ORU^R01 message with a populated OBX segment, but no data
            	in the mandatory OBR segment which begins the ORDER_OBSERVATION group (see 
            	<![CDATA[<a href="http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/v26/apidocs/ca/uhn/hl7v2/model/v26/group/ORU_R01_ORDER_OBSERVATION.html">reference</a>]]>),

            	if a child structure is a segment or a group. The only provided implementation, AbstractGroup,
            	implements this method, so the API change should not have any effect on users.
