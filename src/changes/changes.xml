        		Fix issue where occasionally a Connection which is
        		sending a message would "miss" an ACK/response message it received and report 
        		that the send timed out.

            <action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3388301">
            	Refactored large parts of the networking functionality in the ca.uhn.hl7v2.app package. Most
				notably, an ExecutorService instance can be injected to customize the threading behavior.
            </action>
			<action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr / James Agnew" issue="3421082">
            	Make TestPanel more usable. Amongst other changes, it's now possible to load HL7 messages 
				directly from a file and to reuse client-side connections even when the MLLP server was 
				restarted in the meanwhile.
            </action>
        	<action type="add" dev="Christian Ohr" issue="3421083">
        		Convert HAPI to use the 
				<![CDATA[
	            	<a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</a>
				]]>
        		logging framework in place of Apache Jakarta Commons-Logging (JCL). SLF4J is 
        		conceptually similar to JCL, in that it is a wrapper around an underlying 
        		framework of your choice (e.g. log4j, java.util.Logger, etc.). It brings a number
        		of modern features with it, such as parameterized entries and NDCs, and uses a
        		less confusing discovery process.
				<![CDATA[<br><br>]]>
				Applications which use HAPI will now need to add the "slf4j-api.jar" JAR to their
				classpath, as well as a second JAR such as "slf4j-log4j12.jar" which instructs SLF4J
				which underlying log framework to use. These two dependencies have been added to the
				hapi-base pom.xml, so Maven users will see this change automatically.
				<![CDATA[<br><br>]]>
        		In addition, HapiLog has been deprecated. HapiLog was used as a logging system prior to
        		the introduction of commons-logging into HAPI. It is no longer referenced by any
        		part of HAPI itself, and will be removed at some point in the future.

        	<action type="add" dev="James Agnew">
        		Add new method to group and message structure classes that returns all repetitions
        		of repeatable children as a typed List. This is useful for quickly and easily
        		iterating over structures within a message.

            	beginning to end. 
            	For example, in an ORU^R01 message with a populated OBX segment, but no data

            	Correct issue where extra components in primitive types within OBX-5 appear twice when
            	message is re-encoded. This is useful, for example, if you are receiving messages
            	from a system which is not correctly escaping ampersands or carats within
            	an OBX-5 value. Prior to chis change, a message containing the following
            	segment:
				<![CDATA[
<pre>
   OBX||ST|||F1C1^F2C1&F2C2
</pre>
				]]>

<pre>
   OBX||ST|||F1C1&F2C2^F2C1&F2C2

            	went wrong and this file was blank, a hard to debug exception was thrown. Now, control ID sequencing is simply

            	(represented by the text F1C2 below) would be lost.
