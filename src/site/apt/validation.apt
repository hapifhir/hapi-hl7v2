Validation of HL7 messages

* Introduction
  
  HL7 v2.x is a complex flat-file structure that, despite being considered a data standard, 
  is also highly flexible. It is often expected of an HL7 library that non-standard compliant 
  data be accepted and processed without notification to the receiving system of non-compliance.

  However, to achieve real interoperability, the HL7 standard should be constrained to reduce the 
  degree of freedom e.g. how to use certain fields or whether to populate optional fields or not. 
  This happens either based on a written specification or in addition as machine-readble conformance profile. 
  In order to check whether HL7 messages actually conform to the defined constraints, message validation is essential.
  
  
* Validation Rules and RuleBindings

  The HAPI library offers support for validating HL7 messages by definition of rules 
  that check against constraints on primitive type level, message level, and encoded message level. 
  
  [<<PrimitiveTypeRule>>] A validation rule that applies to primitive types like ID, IS, NM. PrimitiveTypeRules
  are enforced every time a primitive value is set. 

  [<<MessageRule>>] A validation rule that applies to a fully populated message object.  MessageRules 
  are enforced (depending on runtime configuration) just after an inbound message
  has been parsed, or just before an outbound message is encoded.  
   
  [<<EncodingRule>>] A validation rule that applies to encoded message strings.  EncodingRules are intended 
  for criteria that are specific to the encoded form of a message, e.g. "no empty tags in an XML message". 
  EncodingRules are enforced (depending on runtime configuration) before an inbound message
  is parsed, or just after an outbound message has been encoded.  

  Rules of all types described above are <bound> to a HL7 version and <scoped> depending on the rule type.
  The scope of a PrimitiveTypeRule is a (you guessed it!) a primitive type. The scope of a
  MessageRule is its event type and trigger event (e.g. ADT_A01). The scope of a EncodingRule is its
  encoding - "XML" or "VB" (vertical bar).
  
  Binding and scope determine which rules are applied to which parts of a certain message.
  
  There is a predefined set of default PrimitiveTypeRules that
  conform to the HL7 specification for the corresponding types (DefaultValidation). 
  This set is used when no other rules have been defined. Other predefined sets are
  DefaultValidationWithoutTN and NoValidation.
  
* ValidationContext

  A ValidationContext is the place where Rules and RuleBindings are collected. Parsers and
  Message Validators can be configured with a ValidationContext to enforce validation during
  parsing, encoding, or on demand. 
  
* RuleBuilders

  In HAPI 2.0 and before, custom validation rules had to be implemented by extending the appropriate
  rule types, define their bindings, and collect them in a subclass of ValidationContext. This
  API can be very cumbersome to use, particularly when large sets of rules need to be defined.
  A new API implementing a Builder pattern allows to define rules in a way that is 
  easy to write and to understand.
  
  As the default rule sets have been re-implemented as well, they serve as a
  good example. The primary class is now <<<ValidationRuleBuilder>>> instead of
  <<<ValidationContext>>>:
  
+---------------------------------------+
  public class DefaultValidationWithoutTNBuilder extends ValidationRuleBuilder {

	public void configure() {
		forAllVersions()
		
			// you can trim the value before validation
			.primitive("FT").trimmed(maxLength(32000))
			.primitive("ST", "TX").trimmed()
			
			// you can apply the same rule to more than one type
			.primitive("ID", "IS").is(maxLength(200))
			
			// you can also accept empty values
			.primitive("SI").is(emptyOr(nonNegativeInteger()))
			.primitive("NM").is(emptyOr(number()))
			
			// you can provide a reference to a section in the spec
			.primitive("DT")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.5 Section 2.A.21")
				.is(emptyOr(date()))
			.primitive("TM")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.5 Section 2.A.75")
				.is(emptyOr(time()))
			.primitive("NULLDT").is(withdrawn());
		
		forVersion().before(Version.V25)
			.primitive("TSComponentOne")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.4 Section 2.9.47")
				.is(emptyOr(dateTime()));
		
		forVersion().asOf(Version.V25)
			.primitive("TSComponentOne", "DTM")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.5 Section 2.A.22")
				.is(emptyOr(dateTime25()));
	}
  }
+---------------------------------------+
  
  To define a custom rule builder, you overwrite {{{http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/base/apidocs/ca/.../ValidationRuleBuilder.html}ValidationRuleBuilder}}
  or a subclass thereof, and implement the <<<configure>>> method.
   
  <<<DefaultValidationWithoutTNBuilder>>> defines PrimitiveTypeRules that are either valid for all HL7 v2 versions 
  or for a subset thereof. In this example, the defined rules require the primitive values 
  to not exceed a maximum length, to be numeric, or to
  follow a certain time or date pattern. Empty values are usually allowed. Optionally you
  can add a reference to the HL7 specification for documentation.
  
  While the legacy API is still available (although partly deprecated) and used under
  the hood, the new API is far more expressive and the rule definitions in the example above 
  only take about 25% of the corresponding amount of legacy code.
  
  In order to add your own rules, you can subclass an existing <<<ValidationRuleBuilder>>>:
  
+---------------------------------------+
  public class DefaultValidationBuilder extends DefaultValidationWithoutTNBuilder {

	@Override
	public void configure() {
		super.configure(); // don't forget this!

		forAllVersions()
			.primitive("TN")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.4 Section 2.9.45")
				.is(emptyOr(usPhoneNumber()));
	}
  }
+---------------------------------------+
  
  Now let's add some fictive MessageRules that define expectations towards
  the existence of patient identifiers (PID-2, PID-3), and forbids all
  messages of HL7 versions 2.4 and before, providing a custom explanation:
  
+---------------------------------------+
  public class MyCustomRuleBuilder extends DefaultValidationBuilder {

	public void configure() {
	
		super.configure(); // don't forget this!
		
		forVersion(Version.V25)
			.message("ADT", "*")
				.description("custom message rules")
				.terser("PID-2", empty())
				.terser("PID-3", allOf(maxLength(10), startsWith("A")))
			.message("ORU", "R01")
				.terser("MSH-9-1", isEqual("ORU"));
		
		forVersion(Version.V26)
			.message("ADT", "*")
				.terser("PID-2", empty())
				.terser("PID-3", allOf(maxLength(10), startsWith("B")))
		
		forVersion().before(Version.V25)
			.message("*", "*")
				.description("Old HL7 version not supported!")
				.alwaysFails()
	}
  }
+---------------------------------------+

  Alternatively, if you prefer composition over inheritance, 
  you can simply extend DelegatingValidationBuilder :

+---------------------------------------+
  public class MyCustomRuleBuilder extends DelegatingValidationBuilder {

	public MyCustomRuleBuilder() {
		super(new DefaultValidationBuilder())
	}
	
	public void configure() {
		// ... same as above
	}
  }
+---------------------------------------+
