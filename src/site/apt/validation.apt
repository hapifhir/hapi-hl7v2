Validation of HL7 messages

* Introduction
  
  HL7 v2.x is a complex flat-file structure that, despite being considered a data standard, 
  is also highly flexible. It is often expected of an HL7 library that non-standard compliant 
  data be accepted and processed without notification to the receiving system of non-compliance.

  However, to achieve real interoperability, the HL7 standard should be constrained to reduce the 
  degree of freedom e.g. how to use certain fields or whether to populate optional fields or not. 
  This happens either based on a written specification or in addition as machine-readble conformance profile. 
  In order to check whether HL7 messages actually conform to the defined constraints, message validation is essential.
  
  
* Validation Rules and RuleBindings

  The HAPI library offers support for validating HL7 messages by definition of rules 
  that check against constraints on primitive type level, message level, and encoded message level. 
  
  [<<PrimitiveTypeRule>>] A validation rule that applies to primitive types like ID, IS, NM. PrimitiveTypeRules
  are enforced every time a primitive value is set. 

  [<<MessageRule>>] A validation rule that applies to a fully populated message object.  MessageRules 
  are enforced (depending on runtime configuration) just after an inbound message
  has been parsed, or just before an outbound message is encoded.  
   
  [<<EncodingRule>>] A validation rule that applies to encoded message strings.  EncodingRules are intended 
  for criteria that are specific to the encoded form of a message, e.g. "no empty tags in an XML message". 
  EncodingRules are enforced (depending on runtime configuration) before an inbound message
  is parsed, or just after an outbound message has been encoded.  

  Rules of all types described above are <bound> to a HL7 version and <scoped> depending on the rule type.
  The scope of a PrimitiveTypeRule is a (you guessed it!) a primitive type. The scope of a
  MessageRule is its event type and trigger event (e.g. ADT_A01). The scope of a EncodingRule is its
  encoding - "XML" or "VB" (vertical bar).
  
  Binding and scope determine which rules are applied to which parts of a certain message.
  
  There is a predefined set of default PrimitiveTypeRules that
  conform to the HL7 specification for the corresponding types (DefaultValidation). 
  This set is used when no other rules have been defined. Other predefined sets are
  DefaultValidationWithoutTN and NoValidation.
  
* ValidationContext

  A ValidationContext is the place where Rules and RuleBindings are collected. Parsers and
  Message Validators can be configured with a ValidationContext to enforce validation during
  parsing, encoding, or on demand. 
  
* RuleBuilders

  Until HAPI 2.0, custom validation rules have to be implemented by extending the appropriate
  rule types, define their binding, and collect them in a subclass of ValidationContext. This
  API can be very cumbersome, particularly when large sets of rules are defined.
  This has been augmented by a new API that implements the Builder pattern and allows to define 
  rules in a way that is particularly easy to write and to understand.
  
  As the default rule sets have been re-implemented as well, they serve as a
  good example:
  
+---------------------------------------+
  public class DefaultValidationWithoutTNBuilder extends ValidationRuleBuilder {

	public void configure() {
		forAllVersions()
			.primitive("FT").trimmed(maxLength(32000))
			.primitive("ST", "TX").trimmed()
			.primitive("ID", "IS").is(maxLength(200))
			.primitive("SI").is(emptyOr(nonNegativeInteger()))
			.primitive("NM").is(emptyOr(number()))
			.primitive("DT")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.5 Section 2.A.21")
				.is(emptyOr(date()))
			.primitive("TM")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.5 Section 2.A.75")
				.is(emptyOr(time()))
			.primitive("NULLDT").is(withdrawn());
		
		forVersion().before(Version.V25)
			.primitive("TSComponentOne")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.4 Section 2.9.47")
				.is(emptyOr(dateTime()));
		
		forVersion().asOf(Version.V25)
			.primitive("TSComponentOne", "DTM")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.5 Section 2.A.22")
				.is(emptyOr(dateTime25()));
	}
  }
+---------------------------------------+
  
  To define a custom rule builder, you overwrite {{{http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/base/apidocs/ca/.../ValidationRuleBuilder.html}ValidationRuleBuilder}}
  or a subclass thereof, and implement the <<<configure>>> method.
   
  This builder only defines PrimitiveTypeRules that are either valid for all HL7 v2 versions 
  or for a subset thereof.
  The rules require the primitive values to not exceed a maximum length, to be numeric, or to
  follow a certain time or date pattern. Empty values are usually allowed. Optionally you
  can add a reference to the HL7 specification for documentation.
  
  While the legacy API is still available (although partly deprecated) and used under
  the hood, the new API is far more expressive and the rule definitions in the example above 
  only requires 25% about of the corresponding amount of legacy code.
  
  In order to add rules, you can subclass a ValidationRuleBuilder:
  
+---------------------------------------+
  public class DefaultValidationBuilder extends DefaultValidationWithoutTNBuilder {

	@Override
	public void configure() {
		super.configure(); // don't forget this!

		forAllVersions()
			.primitive("TN")
				.refersToSection("Version 2.4 Section 2.9.45")
				.is(emptyOr(usPhoneNumber()));
	}
  }
+---------------------------------------+
  
  Now let's add some fictive MessageRules that define expectations towards
  the existence of patient identifiers (PID-2, PID-3), and forbids all
  messages of HL7 versions 2.4 and before with a custom explanation.
  
+---------------------------------------+
  public class MyCustomRuleBuilder extends DefaultValidationBuilder {

	public void configure() {
	
		super.configure(); // don't forget this!
		
		forVersion(Version.V25)
			.message("ADT", "*")
				.description("custom message rules")
				.terser("PID-2", empty())
				.terser("PID-3", allOf(maxLength(10), startsWith("A")))
			.message("ORU", "R01")
				.terser("MSH-9-1", isEqual("ORU"));
		
		forVersion(Version.V26)
			.message("ADT", "*")
				.terser("PID-2", empty())
				.terser("PID-3", allOf(maxLength(10), startsWith("B")))
		
		forVersion().before(Version.V25)
			.message("*", "*")
				.description("Old HL7 version not supported!")
				.alwaysFails()
	}
  }
