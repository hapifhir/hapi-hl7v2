				This is the home page for the HAPI project. HAPI (HL7 application
				programming interface;
				pronounced "happy") is an open-source,
				object-oriented HL7 2.x parser for
				Java.
				HL7
				(
				<a href="http://hl7.org">http://hl7.org</a>
				)
				is a messaging specification for healthcare information systems.
				This project is not affiliated with the HL7 organization; we are
				just
				writing some software
				that conforms to their specification. The
				project was initiated by
				<a href="http://www.uhn.ca">University Health Network</a>
				(a large multi-site teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada).

		<section name="New Developments! Jan 22, 2012">
		
			<p>
				The new year brings three new developments to HAPI!
			</p>
			
			<subsection name="New Beta Release!">
				<p>
					First, a new beta release of HAPI has bee posted to the download pages,
					as well as to the Maven central repo. HAPI 2.0-beta1 brings with it
					a number of exciting new features, and a number of bug fixes, which you 
					can read about in the
					<a href="changes-report.html">Changelog</a>. In particular, a huge refactoring
					of the .app package (containing ConnectionHub, SimpleServer, etc.) to overhaul
					the thread management was committed by Christian Ohr.
				</p>
				<p>
					This release contains a number
					of contributions from all over the world. Thanks to everyone who got
					involved!
				</p> 
				<p>
					Please be aware that this is still a beta release, and hasn't yet been
					thoroughly tested. In particular, <a href="./surefire-report.html">several unit tests</a>
					are still not passing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hl7api/files/hl7api-unstable/2.0-beta1/">Download it here</a>
				</p>
			</subsection>
					
			<subsection name="New TestPanel!">
				<p>
					Secondly, hUnit and the HAPI TestPanel have been combined, to make
					a fantastic new HL7 testing tool, "TestPanel 2.0". The new panel
					is a full featured testing and editing suite with support for all
					kinds of useful things including SSL, MLLP packet capture, validation,
					conformance profiles, and more.   
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="./hapi-testpanel/index.html">Learn More</a>
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Message Colouriser!">
				<p>
					Last, and probably least interesting, a new online tool has been added
					to the site which can be used to colourise ER7 encoded messages. This
					is mainly useful to people who want to embed HL7 messages or snippet in
					documentation, emails, web pages, etc. and have them look readable.

				On October 30 2001. Bryan Tripp and a team at University Health Network registered the HAPI
				project with Sourceforge, and a new project was born. On November 15 2001 HAPI 0.1 was
				released, and 10
				releases later HAPI is probably the most widely used HL7 v2
				library there is.
