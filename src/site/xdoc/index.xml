				This is the home page for the HAPI project.
				HAPI (HL7 application
				programming interface;
				pronounced "happy") is an open-source,
				object-oriented HL7 2.x parser for
				Java.
				HL7
				(
				<a href="http://hl7.org">http://hl7.org</a>
				)
				is a messaging specification for healthcare information systems.
				This project is not affiliated with the HL7 organization; we are
				just
				writing some software
				that conforms to their specification. The
				project was initiated by
				<a href="http://www.uhn.ca">University Health Network</a>
				(a large multi-site teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada).

			<p>
				A last minute bug found in HAPI FHIR 2.4 and 2.5 was discovered and fixed, so
				two new releases have been produced.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section name="HAPI HL7v2 2.4 and 2.5 Released - Oct 30, 2023">

			<p>
				Over five years since the last release, we are pleased to announce
				availability of HAPI HL7v2 2.4 and HAPI HL7v2 2.5.
				These releases are being produced on the same day with one difference:
				Version 2.4 uses the legacy javax.servlet package in the hapi-hl7overhttp
				module, whereversion 2.5 uses the new jakarta.servlet package in this module.
				There are no other material differences between the two versions.
				These releases include the following changes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					This release <a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-hl7v2/pull/98/files">addresses</a> a
					security vulnerability in the XML parser used to parse XML-based HL7 v2.x messages.
				</li>
				<li>
					JDK 11+ is now required in order to use or build this library.
				</li>
				<li>
					The Testpanel application can now be run on modern JDKs (the
					previous version failed to start on JDK 9+ due to a Java module
					issue).
				</li>
				<li>
					The module that has historically been used to generate the "HL7 structures"
					source files has been retired, and the generated structures are now checked
					in to the source repository. Unfortunately the generator is not sustainable
					in its current form (it required a Windows XP VM in order to run, and that
					VM has finally stopped working). If you are interested in helping to modernize
					the structures generator, please get in touch!

		<section name="HAPI HL7v2 2.3 Released - Jun 23, 2017">
			
			<p>
				A new version of HAPI HL7v2 has been released! This new version includes a number
				of bugfixes, as well as new message structures for the following versions of
				HL7: v2.7, v2.8, and v2.8.1.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition, we have changed the TestPanel distribution so that it is now
				distributed as a simple executable JAR with some scripts to start it.
			</p>

			<p>
				I want to thank everyone who has been waiting for this release for their patience. 
				I have stated on the mailing list quite a few times over the last few years that a
				new release was imminent, and it never materialized. The basic explanation for this
				is that building a new release has become quite a laborious process that requires
				quite a lot of hand-holding.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				A bit of insight into the HAPI HL7v2 build process: 
				The basic trouble is that building the structures is only possible on a Windows XP
				system because of the way it works. Essentially the build requires an ODBC driver for
				an Access MDB file (this is how the HL7 databases are distributed) and this driver was
				discontinued after Windows XP. Unfortunately the Javac compiler is unwilling to compile
				the large number of files that make up a structure JAR on Windows XP, so the process now
				involves building structures on XP, then copying them into a build on Linux and compiling.
				This whole thing really needs refactoring, but this would be a huge project and isn't
				something we have capacity to take on at this point.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				As an additional note, we have now migrated the project from Sourceforge over to 
				GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-hl7v2">https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-hl7v2</a>.
				The new project website can be found at: 
				<a href="https://hapifhir.github.io/hapi-hl7v2">https://hapifhir.github.io/hapi-hl7v2</a>.
				As a side note, we are now going to refer to this project as 
				"HAPI HL7v2" and the FHIR version of HAPI as "HAPI FHIR". Hopefully this will remove some
				confusion, as these are completely separate libraries with separate release cycles.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release. As always, check the
				the <a href="changes-report.html">Changelog</a> for details about what's
				new.

<!-- 
		<section name="HAPI 2.1 has been released - Mar 25, 2013">

<p>After a much-too-long wait, HAPI 2.1 has been released. Once again, this relasse is packed with new features. Most importantly it begins a transition to a simplified API where everything is centered around a&nbsp;<a href="http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/base/apidocs/ca/uhn/hl7v2/DefaultHapiContext.html">HapiContext</a>&nbsp;that acts as a kind of "gateway" into the whole API, and a start down the road to eventually merging the powerful parts of the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><span style="color: #274e13;">.protocol.*</span> </span>hierarchy with the easy to use <span style="color: #274e13; font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">.app.*</span> hierarchy.<br />
<br />
The API changes are non-breaking, so existing applications will work without modification, but we would encourage developers to migrate their code where possible to use the new APIs, since this will make code more readable. Information on how to migrate is found&nbsp;<a href="http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/upgrade_to_hapi_2_1.html">here.</a><br />
<br />
As always, a complete changelog is available&nbsp;<a href="http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html">here</a>. The website has also been enhanced with a new page outlining the&nbsp;<a href="http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/hapi-sourcegen/confgen-usage.html">Maven plugins</a>&nbsp;available. This means that we finally have a good document explaning how one might generate their own custom message structure classes using Message Workbench (something we have been doing for years at <a href="http://www.uhn.ca/">UHN</a>&nbsp;but have never documented).<br />
<br />
The new release has been uploaded to Sourceforge, and has also had time to synchronize to the global Maven repos, so it should be fully available now. Thanks to everyone who contributed!</p>

		<section name="HL7 over HTTP Update - Aug 23, 2012">

			<p>
				A number of suggestions, comments, and other feedback have
				been worked into the draft
				<a href="hapi-hl7overhttp/specification.html">specification</a>
				which has now been posted.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition, a completely functional Java based implementation
				of the specification has been developed and is now available for
				download (in alpha form) and testing.

		<section name="HAPI 2.0 and TestPanel 2.0 Released! Jul 17, 2012">

			<p>
				Today marks a big milestone for HAPI, with the release of version 2.0 of both
				the HAPI Java API and the HAPI TestPanel.
			</p>

			<p>
				The new release comes packed with tons of bugfixes, plenty of new features,
				and improvements. See the <a href="changes-report.html">Changelog</a> for
				information on everything that is new.
			</p>

			<p>
				One thing to note: Migrating to the new version of the Java API should be
				very straightforward, but there is one notable difference to watch out for:
				As of version 2.0 the logging abstraction layer has changes from commons-logging to
				<a href="http://www.slf4j.org/">SLF4J</a>, so you will need to include the
				SLf4J API JAR on your classpath. You will probably want to include an
				adaptor to an underlying logging framework as well. Maven users can copy the
				updated POM dependency snippets from <a href="using_maven.html">here</a>. Non-Maven
				users will find the new requirements in the "hapi-all" bundle on the
				<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hl7api/files/hl7api/2.0/">Download</a>
				area.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thanks to everyone who contributed! In particular, this release features a huge
				set of contributions from Christian Ohr, who cleaned up a lot of old codebase,
				modernized the SimpleServer, and replaced the logging framework. It's great to
				see that the HAPI community continues to gain traction after a decade!

		<section name="New Developments! Jan 22, 2012">

			<p>
				The new year brings three new developments to HAPI!
			</p>

			<subsection name="New Beta Release!">
				<p>
					First, a new beta release of HAPI has bee posted to the download pages,
					as well as to the Maven central repo. HAPI 2.0-beta1 brings with it
					a number of exciting new features, and a number of bug fixes, which you
					can read about in the
					<a href="changes-report.html">Changelog</a>. In particular, a huge refactoring
					of the .app package (containing ConnectionHub, SimpleServer, etc.) to overhaul
					the thread management was committed by Christian Ohr.
				</p>
				<p>
					This release contains a number
					of contributions from all over the world. Thanks to everyone who got
					involved!
				</p>
				<p>
					Please be aware that this is still a beta release, and hasn't yet been
					thoroughly tested. In particular, <a href="./surefire-report.html">several unit tests</a>
					are still not passing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/hl7api/files/hl7api-unstable/2.0-beta1/">Download it here</a>
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="New TestPanel!">
				<p>
					Secondly, hUnit and the HAPI TestPanel have been combined, to make
					a fantastic new HL7 testing tool, "TestPanel 2.0". The new panel
					is a full featured testing and editing suite with support for all
					kinds of useful things including SSL, MLLP packet capture, validation,
					conformance profiles, and more.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="./hapi-testpanel/index.html">Learn More</a>
				</p>
			</subsection>

			<subsection name="Message Colouriser!">
				<p>
					Last, and probably least interesting, a new online tool has been added
					to the site which can be used to colourise ER7 encoded messages. This
					is mainly useful to people who want to embed HL7 messages or snippets in
					documentation, emails, web pages, etc. and have them look readable.

				On October 30 2001. Bryan Tripp and a team at University Health Network registered the HAPI
				project with Sourceforge, and a new project was born. On November 15 2001 HAPI 0.1 was
				released, and 10
				releases later HAPI is probably the most widely used HL7 v2
				library there is.
