				This is the homepage for the HL7 over HTTP initiative. Welcome!
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<b>Note that this specification is still being drafted! Documentation here refers
				to a reference implementation which will be available shortly.</b>
			</p>

			<p>
				HL7 over HTTP is a new transport mechanism aimed at replacing the 
				traditional HL7 v2 Mininal Lower Layer Protocol (MLLP) transport
				with a modern, standards-based approach. We believe that MLLP should
				be retired completely, and we are working to make that a reality.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				This site has two useful sections:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The <a href="specification.html"><b>Specification</b></a> itself.
					We are soliciting opinions and comments on this specification, so 
					please get in touch.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <b>Java based API</b> for implementing
					HL7 over HTTP in your application. The Java based API can be
					embedded in applications that 
					<a href="doc_hapi.html">do use HAPI</a>, 
					and in applications that
					<a href="doc_non_hapi.html">don't otherwise use HAPI</a>.
					Our Java API is Apache licensed, so it is free for
					use in all kinds of software, including commercial software!
