	<comment>HAPI (HL7 application programming interface; pronounced &quot;happy&quot;) is an open-source, 
		object-oriented HL7 2.x parser for Java.  HL7 (http://hl7org)  is a messaging 
		specification for healthcare information systems.  This project is not affiliated with 
		the HL7 organization; we are just writing some software that conforms to their 
		specification.  The project was initiated by University Health Network 
		(a large multi-site teaching hospital in Toronto, Canada). NO_M2ECLIPSE_SUPPORT: Project files created with the maven-eclipse-plugin are not supported in M2Eclipse.</comment>
